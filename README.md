# MscIDS_CIP

This repository was created during the Module "Data Collection, Integration and Preprocessing". The goal was to plan and run a classical ETL-Process, which contains three different dataset, from which two has to be scrapped and one can be downloaded from kaggle. With these data some predefined questions had to be answered.

## Questions

- Does the success (clicks, views, etc.) in digital media also show in the winners of the main categories of the Grammy Awards?
- Does the song duration have an influence on the views on youtube?
- How have the song attributes "beats per minute" and "duration" of the successful songs on Spo-tify changed since 2010?
